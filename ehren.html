	<h2>General Information</h2>
	<p>The objectives of our project is to reduce carbon emissions from cars and delivery trucks by providing information on whether items are in stock in retail stores such as target, best buy, new egg, and BH photo. We want the product to allow people to only have to make one trip to a retail store that has their desired items rather than them having to make multiple trips to different retail stores, which produces more carbon emissions. This will also reduce the need for delivery trucks as less people will resort to ordering items online. This could reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly. The product is also able to provide the user with statistics on COVID-19 to help keep them aware.</p>
